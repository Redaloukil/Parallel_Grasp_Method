1 - parcel.cpp : contains sequetial procedure for grasp implementation. 
2 - cuda.cpp : contains parrallel procedure for grasp implementation.
3 - main.cpp : contains execution of construnction phase + localSearch
4 - random.cpp : contains execution of path randomSearch. 
5 - 
6 -  

1 - Get min and max , lunch cuda threads to get the minimum value.
2 - Every Thread constructs its local rcl.



1 - malloc list called rcl.
2 - each kernel search for the adequate elements and put it to it's local rcl.
3 - each kernel select random element from local rcl.
4 - each kernel select an element and isnert it the global rcl via mapping fucntion.
4 - select randomnly from rcl.
4 - while path length != go to 1 -
